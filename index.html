			<div class="instructions">
				<ul>
					<li>One person is the one drawing the word, and the rest of the players are the ones guessing </li>
					<br>
					<li>Each player can make a guess as to what the drawing is after each stroke</li>
					<br>
					<li>If the players guess wrong, then the person drawing adds a body part to the hangman </li>
					<br>
					<li>If the players guess your drawing before the hangman is complete, you lose</li>
					<br>
					<li>If the players are not successful in guessing, you win</li>
